# Emotion-Detection-System-Flask-API

● Developed an Emotion detection system which can detect emotion of a user given tweet posted. This is end to end Data science project. 

● Deployed this Machine learning model into production as Rest API using Flask, Docker, Kubernetes.

● Beginning with Data collection performed text cleaning, vectorization using Pretrained word embeddings FastText. Built the model using Deep learning RNN (GRU, LSTM) architecture. Performed sampling strategies to encounter imbalance data. Achieved best F1 score of 0.68.
